# **Welcome to Owens Bookkeeping and Tax!**

In this website, you will see a few things:
    - **The Header** *
    You will see a shortened title (Owens Books & Tax) unless your screen width is above 768px (Owens Bookkeeping & Tax)
    - **The Hamburger** *
    You will see 3 lines. Click, and voila! you will see the 4 subheadings. If your screen width is above 768px, you will just see the subheadings with no hamburger.
    - **The Carousel** *
    A simple image carousel which rotates thru 5 different images.
    - **The Main Content** *
    A single column of content, which is actually 3 "columns" if your screen size is above 768px.

# **Tech Used Here:**

    - **CSS**
    The CSS employed here helps create the hamburger menu and the column layout of the main content area. It also helps style the image carousel.
    CSS is contained in the CSS subfolder. There are two external sheets, "style2.css" and "normalize.css"
    - **Javascript**
    Javascript is used to create the image carousel. It lives in a separate folder as "kitty.js"
